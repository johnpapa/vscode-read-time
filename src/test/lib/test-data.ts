Yes, Yes, without the oops! You really think you can fly that thing? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.

Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? You really think you can fly that thing? Life finds a way. Just my luck, no ice. I was part of something special. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.

Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. What do they got in there? King Kong? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.

Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Must go faster. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? You really think you can fly that thing?

You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

Checkmate... Did he just throw my cat out of the window? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.
